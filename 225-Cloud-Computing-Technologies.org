#+BEGIN_COMMENT
Unit IV is from the course Cloud Computing IF7202, Anna University. M.E CSE - R2015. 
Apache Hadoop is not  included here, as it will be covered in Big Data Analytics course. (YVL)

|Unit V|Cloud Security|9|
Multi-tenancy Issues: Isolation of users/VMs from each other --
Virtualization System Vulnerabilities: Management console
vulnerabilities -- management server vulnerabilities -- administrative
VM vulnerabilities -- guest VM vulnerabilities, hypervisor
vulnerabilities -- hypervisor escape vulnerabilities -- configuration
issues; Virtualization System-Specific Attacks: Guest hopping --
attacks on the VM (delete the VM, attack on the control of the VM,
code or file injection into the virtualized file structure) -- VM
migration attack -- hyperjacking.
#+latex: % As we changed entire Unit - V from AU syllabus, Unit V is from the course Cloud Security CC2005, SRM University. M.Tech in Cloud Computing. (YVL)
